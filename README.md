# web-3.0-project_01

This is a my first Web 3.0 project that is built using React JS and the Ethereum blockchain to provide functionalities such as
connecting your wallet through Meta Mask in browser, sending Ethereum to a recepient and being able to post a GIF on the 
web app using IPFS. Credits to JavaScript Mastery for providing an amazing course on the project. I put my own unique design 
spin on the web app to make it more unqiue.
